# Dataware House for Healthcare Center
<br />

<p style="font-size: 36px; font-weight: 600;">What's inside?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Python Script for making random data</li>
    <li>Sql code that fill the dataware house(ETL)</li>
    <li>Docker compose for creating sql server container(Optional if you already have it)</li>
</ul>
<br />


<p style="font-size: 36px; font-weight: 600;">How to run?</p>
<ol>
    <li>First you should run the docker compose(make sure docker is installed)</li>
    <li>Then you should run the python script to generate a sql code for filling source databse(it tries to be random)</li>
    <li>After running python script you should connect a database client it can be either sql server management studio or other clients i.e Datagrip or just connect to databse via code(you have to install the sql server driver if you are willing to use code)</li>
    <li>You should run sql files in this order: setup.sql, source.sql, data.sql, staging.sql, dataware_house.sql</li>
    <li>The process takes very long time about 3-4 hours because the there are many records(millions) and the process scans the records partially each time to avoid lack of memory</li>
</ol>

<p style="font-size: 36px; font-weight: 600;">How python script works?</p>
<p>
    The python script is a little bit confusing, the whole duty of this script
    is to mix all predefined data together with some random numbers. Predefined
    datas are generated by ChatGPT and any adding or deleting have impact on the
    number of output records, i.e. if you add increase firstname and lastnames in
    patient predefined data the impact is huge I put 100 firstnames and 100 lastnames
    and the number of patients are 10,000 and if you add 10 to each you get 12,100
    you only added 20 new items but got 2100 more records. There are other ways to increase
    the number of records the code is well commented and you can tweak the settings
    to get more records or less records, but if you want to get 1 million records
    the process takes much longer but other like Visit and Treatment to get 10 million
    records the time is not much different, but I highly suggest to not change anything
    and stick to the default numbers. I tried to produce the data that look legit
    but there are definitely medical errors, and some errors are generated by ChatGPT
    and some are generated because of randomness, but I works properly as a source
    for dataware house.
